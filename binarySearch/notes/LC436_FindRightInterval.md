# LC 436 Find Right Interval
## 问题描述
You are given an array of intervals, where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] and each starti is unique.

The right interval for an interval i is an interval j such that startj >= endi and startj is minimized. Note that i may equal j.

Return an array of right interval indices for each interval i. If no right interval exists for interval i, then put -1 at index i.

### Input and Output
```text
Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,2]]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: There is only one interval in the collection, so it outputs -1.

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[3,4],[2,3],[1,2]]
Output: [-1,0,1]
Explanation: There is no right interval for [3,4].
The right interval for [2,3] is [3,4] since start0 = 3 is the smallest start that is >= end1 = 3.
The right interval for [1,2] is [2,3] since start1 = 2 is the smallest start that is >= end2 = 2.

Example 3:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: [-1,2,-1]
Explanation: There is no right interval for [1,4] and [3,4].
The right interval for [2,3] is [3,4] since start2 = 3 is the smallest start that is >= end1 = 3.
```

## 分析
- intervals是若干组区间，[start_i,end_i] start_i <= end_i
- 各组的start_i是不同的
- input没说有序，需要自己排列
- intervals长度[1,2*10^4]
- start和end的范围[-10^6, 10^6]
- 返回的是index下标，但由于排序了，需要记录原始的start的位置
